# ECOAR
My implementations of the projects for the Computer Architecture subject. 
# MARS
The task was to design Flood Fill algorithm for 24 bmp bpp files containing black lines on a white background. To run the project, download Mars simulator and enter x and y coordinates and color in RGB.
# x86
The task was to reduce the contrast of 24 bmp bpp image by scaling the primary colors from the range 0..255 to 128-rfactor..128+rfactor, where rfactor = 1..127. To run the project, change properly the name of the folder in makefile. From "asm2" to your folder name and after compilation run the following command:
./program.exe in.bmp 90
